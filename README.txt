Project 2

To execute the program use the following command:
	make

Our parser takes a text file with the program as an input file. A dollar sign is required in the end of the file to mark the end of the program.
When syntax errors occur, they are printed during the parsing as well as in the end of the output. TODO: - errors 
Both production rules and the syntax tree are printed to standard output and the syntax tree is only printed when no errors occur. The syntax tree is printed first in the tabulated and then in a non-tabulated format.
